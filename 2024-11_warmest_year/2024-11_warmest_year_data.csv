# Description: This file contains annual mean surface air temperature anomalies from ERA5 averaged over the global domain (0–360°E, 90°S–90°N) from 1940 to 2024
# Reference period: The anomalies are relative to the pre-industrial reference period (1850-1900)
# Data source: ERA5 monthly gridded data can be downloaded from https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means
# Method: A single offset of +0.88°C is used to convert the original anomalies relative to 1991-2020 to anomalies relative to 1850-1900.
# Important note: The value for 2024 is provisional and based on data for 10 months (January to October).
# Units: deg. C
# Last updated: 5 Nov 2024
